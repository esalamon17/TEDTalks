Final Project for INFO 3350: Texting Mining History and Literature with Matthew Wilkens

By: Eliza Salamon

I am interested in the relationship between an author’s biography and the speech they give. Presumably, speakers invited to TED Talks give speeches about topics they are interested in, which will align with their background, career, accomplishments, etc, which are generally outlined in a person's biography. Due to the criticism of TED talks as being surface-level and predictable, I want to explore whether models are successful at matching speech transcripts to the biographies of their speakers — and hypothesize that they will not.
